This is the description for the card game President

President is a 4-player card game, also called other more explicit
names by the playerbase. 

Win conditions: The objective of President is for the player to discard 
all their cards before the other players. The first player to do so 
is declared the winner, and upon completion of this task, the game ends.

Equipment: 4 players are required to play this game. It is played using
a normal 52-card deck consisting of cards in the following rank order
of highest order card to lowest: 2, Ace (A), King(K), Queen(Q), Jack(J)
, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3.  The suit has no bearing on the card's rank,
and can essentially be ignored for purposes of the game. 

Playing Area/Board:

Actions Each Turn: 
	The game begins with the cards being shuffled
into a random order. The cards are then dealt clockwise until all cards
have been dealt, so in a 4-player game each player should be dealt 
13 random cards from the 52-card deck. The player order is also rotated
in a clockwise manner. It is assumed that this game will be played around
a square table with 4 positions: the 12'o clock, 3'o clock, 6'o clock, 
and 9'o clock. Therefore the starting player will be in the 12'o clock,
then the next player is in 3, 6, then 9 until it rotates back to the 12.

	Each player in turn must choose to pass the turn in which case they 
do not play any cards
